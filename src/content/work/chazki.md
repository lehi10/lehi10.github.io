As a **Front-end Developer** at Chazki, I worked on the development of a **web and mobile application** designed to enhance last-mile logistics management. This platform replaced Chazki’s existing system, enabling the company to expand operations and serve more clients across **Chile, Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia**.

### Key Contributions:
- **Frontend Development:** Built and optimized the web and mobile interfaces using **React.js** and **React Native**.
- **State Management & UI:** Integrated **Apollo Client** for GraphQL data handling and used **Ant Design** for UI components.
- **Real-time Tracking:** Implemented **Google Maps** for live tracking and optimized geolocation features.
- **Backend Integration:** Contributed to backend tasks using **Express.js** and **PostgreSQL**, ensuring efficient data storage and API performance.
- **User Analytics:** Integrated **Pendo** for tracking user interactions and improving the customer experience.

This project significantly improved **Chazki’s logistics efficiency** and streamlined operations, allowing the company to scale and manage deliveries more effectively across multiple regions.
