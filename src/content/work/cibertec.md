As a **part-time instructor at Cibertec**, I have been responsible for teaching courses in **software development and testing** to students in a professional training program. My role involves designing and delivering structured lessons, guiding students through hands-on projects, and preparing them for real-world software development challenges.

### Key Courses Taught:
